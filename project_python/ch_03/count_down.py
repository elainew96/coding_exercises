Exercise: Count down

Objective: Write a while loop that changes a variable and stops when that variable reaches a particular value.
Write a program that counts down from 100 to 0 backwards by twos. If you need to, write out all of the print statements by hand, look at
whatâ€™s changing, and introduce a variable to allow that change using repeated lines of code. Then wrap into a while loop.

i = 100
while (i>=0):
    print(i)
    i -= 2
