Exercise: smile

Objective: learn how to call drawing library functions that take parameters, in order to draw a desired complex picture.
Write a program that causes a yellow smiley face to be drawn on the screen. You have a 200 by 200 window available.
Draw the outline of the face. Put your code for drawing the outline after the line # draw the outline of the face. (Lines that begin with # are ignored by the computer, and are for human readers only.
Draw the eyes. Put your code for drawing the eyes after the line # draw the eyes.
Bonus challenge. Draw the mouth. Hint â€“ draw a circle, and then erase the top part of it by drawing some sort of yellow shape.
